This PILOT interpreter was lovingly built to be as compatible as possible with the PILOT implementation released for Atari 8-bit computers. Please refer to these linked PDF user guides for more information about PILOT:

NOTES:

This implementation contains none of the Atari graphics functionality (commands prefaced with GR), nor does it contain the sound (SO) command. I am planning on implementing graphics soon, but with a whole new paradigm which is more in line with the realities of modern operating systems and programming languages.

All match (M) conditions are case independent. All match conditions within a match statement must be seperated by a comma. Additionally, the match command will only match conditions to the start of the input being evaluated; it no longer matches cases in the middle of input.

Future development will maintain this base-set of compatibility and will also add new functionality such as: 
	.NET integration 
	Graphics 
	Sound
	Internet commands (page get, page upload, etc.)
	Java version
